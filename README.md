# Object Detection and Tracking using YOLOv8

## Overview

This application performs object detection and tracking using the YOLOv8 model. It is designed to allow users to upload images and videos, or use a webcam, to detect objects in real-time. The app is developed using Streamlit for the front-end interface.
